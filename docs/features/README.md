# Imunify360 Features

[[toc]]

## External Black/Whitelist Management

To use external files with the list of <span class="notranslate">Black/White IPs</span>, place this list into the following directory:

* for the White List:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/etc/imunify360/whitelist/*.txt
```
</div>

* for the Black List:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/etc/imunify360/blacklist/*.txt
```
</div>

The files may have IP addresses or subnet in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).

In order to apply the IP lists, run the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent reload-lists
```
</div>

Or restart the agent.

:::warning Warning
Specifying IPs in those files will not prevent Imunify from adding the same IPs to dynamic lists (like Gray list), but all White lists always have the priority over Black lists when it comes to actual filtering of requests/packages.

## RapidScan

RapidScan feature allows you to increase scanning speed by lower system resource usage and gives you an opportunity to scan more frequently, further hardening your systems’ security posture.

#### RapidScan techniques

* **Faster File Integrity Checking**. File metadata, such as file hashes, are stored locally. This means that unchanged files don't need to be rescanned.
* **Efficient Cloud-assisted Scanning**. Imunify360 stores its malicious file hash database in the cloud. We detect malicious files and skip white-listed files. The remaining files are fewer, so the overall scan time is significantly reduced.
* **Optimized Malware Signatures**. Our malware signature database continually expands to match the variety of malicious software. While the database becomes more accurate and comprehensive, it also becomes larger and more cumbersome to index. We tackle this by actively curating the database and re-evaluating complex signatures, recasting any that affect scanning performance.
 
#### What does it mean to you?

When you first enable the RapidScan feature, the first scan will run as before. But subsequent scans will see a speed improvement, anywhere between 5 to 20 times faster. This is the case for both on-demand and scheduled scans, and means you can afford more scans without affecting system performance.

To take advantage of these new improvements, go to your Imunify360 control panel and enable RapidScan in Settings→Malware Scanner. See details [here](/dashboard/#malware).

## Low Resource Usage mode

This is a special operation mode where Imunify360 consumes less CPU and RAM. It is intended for servers with limited resources.

This mode disables <span class="notranslate">[WebShield](/webshield/)</span> switching off GrayList and Captcha. 

<span class="notranslate">_Low Resource Usage_</span> mode also enables the <span class="notranslate">_[Minimized Modsec Ruleset](/dashboard/#waf-settings)_</span> option that disables Imunify WAF rules with a high memory footprint, leaving critical rulesets enabled. 

When the <span class="notranslate">_Low Resource Usage_</span> mode is activated it is reflected on the UI: an Imunify main menu changes color to light green, and an appropriate label appears on the top right.

## Exim+Dovecot brute-force attack protection

:::tip Note
cPanel only, other panels will be added later
:::

Exim+Dovecot brute-force attack protection is an advanced protection against Dovecot brute-force attacks. PAM module protects against IMAP/POP3 brute-force attack and prevents mail account from being compromised via brute-forcing.

**How to enable Dovecot**

We recommend using Imunify360 agent config to enable Dovecot because this allows to correctly switch OSSEC rules/configs:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"PAM": {"enable": true, "exim_dovecot_protection": true}}'
```
</div>

**How to disable Dovecot**

To disable all PAM module via config file:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"PAM": {"enable": false, "exim_dovecot_protection": false}}'
```
</div>

To disable only Exim+Dovecot via config file:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"PAM": {"exim_dovecot_protection": false}}'
```
</div>


The options of the `pam_imunufy` are placed in the file: <span class="notranslate">`/etc/pam_imunify/i360.ini`</span>

**Values**

| | |
|-|-|
|<span class="notranslate">`USER_LOCK_TIMEOUT=5`</span>|a period of time during which a user should be blocked (minutes)|
|<span class="notranslate">`USER_LOCK_ATTEMPTS=10`</span>|a number of attempts after which a user should be blocked|
|<span class="notranslate">`USER_LOCK_MINUTES=5`</span>|a period of time (minutes) during which violation attempts from a user are counted; all attempts earlier than <span class="notranslate">`USER_LOCK_MINUTES`</span> are not counted|
|<span class="notranslate">`USER_IP_LOCK_TIMEOUT=5`</span>|a period of time during which a user + IP should be blocked (minutes)|
|<span class="notranslate">`USER_IP_LOCK_ATTEMPTS=10`</span>|a number of attempts after which a user + IP should be blocked|
|<span class="notranslate">`USER_IP_LOCK_MINUTES=5`</span>|a period of time (minutes) during which violation attempts from a user + IP are counted; all attempts earlier than <span class="notranslate">`USER_IP_LOCK_MINUTES`</span> are not counted|
|<span class="notranslate">`IP_LOCK_TIMEOUT=5`</span>|a period of time during which an IP should be blocked (minutes)|
|<span class="notranslate">`IP_LOCK_ATTEMPTS=10`</span>|a number of attempts after which an IP should be blocked|
|<span class="notranslate">`IP_LOCK_MINUTES=5`</span>|a period of time during which violation attempts from an IP are counted; all attempts earlier than <span class="notranslate">`IP_LOCK_MINUTES`</span> are not counted|
|<span class="notranslate">`rbl=net-brute.rbl.imunify.com.`</span>| RBL DNS Zone |
|<span class="notranslate">`RBL_timeout=5`</span>|this is the wait time for a response from RBL|
|<span class="notranslate">`RBL_nameserver=ns1-rbl.imunify.com:53`</span>|NS Server|


:::tip Notes

Default RBL block time for IP = 4 hours.

:::


**How to apply settings**

In order to apply new settings in the <span class="notranslate">`/etc/pam_imunify/i360.ini`</span>, run the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
systemctl restart imunify360-pam
```
</div>

#### How it works

During the last <span class="notranslate">`XXX_LOCK_MINUTES`</span> we count the number of login failures (unsuccessful login attempts). If the number of attempts exceeds the specified threshold <span class="notranslate">`XXX_LOCK_ATTEMPTS`</span>, the PAM plugin blocks access for <span class="notranslate">`XXX_LOCK_TIMEOUT`</span> minutes. After that, the counter is reset and the process repeats. 
Note that the plugin has three separate counters and a set of settings for USER/IP/USER+IP management regarding brute-force attacks (see the table above).


:::tip Notes
* If a user is blocked by <span class="notranslate">`USER_LOCK_ATTEMPTS`</span>, then this user will not have access to the server from any IP
* If a user is blocked by <span class="notranslate">`USER_IP_LOCK_ATTEMPTS`</span>, then this user will not have access to the server from that specific IP
* If an IP is blocked by <span class="notranslate">`IP_LOCK_ATTEMPTS`</span>, then all users will not have access to the server from that specific blocked IP

## Hooks

### Overview

Hooks are introduced as a script-based interface for various application events. This is a simple and effective way to automate Imunify360 alerts and event processing.
For example, an administrator can have Imunify360 calling his own script when malicious files are detected or misconfigurations are detected and perform a custom processing or specific actions, for example, create a ticket.
Hooks are available only via CLI.

#### Requirements

* You can use any programming language to create a hook script
* A hook script should be executable
* For Native hooks, you should use Python 3.5 only

### How to start using hooks

Start using hooks with three simple steps:

1) Create a script to handle an event (a hook handler):

   * you can use our [scripts example](/features/#structure-and-examples-of-a-hook-script) as a template
   * [the following events are available](/features/#available-events-and-their-parameters)

2) Register your hook handler in Imunify360 agent - use registration command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent hook add --event <event name> --path </path/to/hook_script>
```

</div>

3) Once the event added - check results and the [log file](/features/#log-file)

### Available events and their parameters

#### agent

* subtype ( started | misconfig )
  * started - the event is generated each time the Imunify agent is started/restarted

    </div>

  * misconfig - the event is generated when the agent detects agent misconfiguration / broken settings / etc.
    * params[]
      * error / string / error message where / what type of misconfiguration was detected and some details

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```

### CLI

The following CLI command is used to manage hooks:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent hook [command] --event [event_name|all] [--path </path/to/hook_script>]
```

</div>

The following commands are supported:

* <span class="notranslate"> **add** </span> - register a new event handler
* <span class="notranslate"> **delete** </span> - unregister existing event handler
* <span class="notranslate"> **list** </span> - show existing event handlers
* <span class="notranslate"> **add-native** </span> - register a new native event handler

The third parameter <span class="notranslate"> _event_name_ </span> defines a particular event that invokes a registered handler as opposed to <span class="notranslate"> **all** </span> keyword.
The fourth parameter `/path/to/hook_script` shall contain a valid path to a handler of the event, it shall be any executable or Python Native event handlers that agent will run upon a registered event.

### Native

Native hook is a script written on Python 3.5 and allows to quickly process events. The Python file should contain only one method that customer would implement:

<div class="notranslate">

```
def im_hook(dict_param):
  …
  pass
```

</div>

where `dict_param` would hold the same data as JSON that non-Native hook would get.

### Log File

You can see all hook data in the log file. It is located at <span class="notranslate"> _/var/log/imunify360/hook.log_ </span> .
When the event comes, the data is recorded to the log file in the following format:

<div class="notranslate">

```
timestamp event : id : started [native:] name :  subtype : script_path
```

</div>

* <span class="notranslate"> **native** </span> is prepended for the Native hook implementation
* <span class="notranslate"> **id** </span> is a unique ID for each event

Once the listener is done, the data is recorded to the log file in the following format:

<div class="notranslate">

```
timestamp event : id : done [native:] script_path [OK|ERROR:code]
```

</div>

In case of an error, you can see the error code you have specified.

### Structure and examples of a hook script

Regular (non-native) hook:

<div class="notranslate">

```
#!/bin/bash

data=$(cat)

event=$(jq -r '.event' <<< ${data})
subtype=$(jq -r '.subtype' <<< ${data})

case ${event} in
    malware-scanning)
        case ${subtype} in
            started)
                # do stuff here
            ;;
            *)
                echo "Unhandled subtype: ${subtype}" 1>&2
                exit 1
        esac
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unhandled event: ${event}/${subtype}" 1>&2
        exit 2
esac
```

</div>

Native hook:

<div class="notranslate">

```
def im_hook(dict_param):
   event = dict_param['event']
   subtype = dict_param['subtype']

   if event == 'malware-scanning':
       if subtype == 'started':
           # do stuff here
           pass
       elif subtype == 'finished':
           # do other stuff here
           pass
       else:
           raise Exception('Unhandled subtype {}'.format(subtype))
   else:
       raise Exception('Unhandled event {}'.format(event))
```

</div>

### Notifications

Starting from version 4.10, an administrator is able to configure email addresses to submit reports and execute custom scripts. Go to <span class="notranslate">_Settings_</span> and choose <span class="notranslate">_Notifications_</span> tab.

![](/images/notifications.png)

* <span class="notranslate">**Default admin emails**</span>: specify the default list of emails used for all enabled admin email notifications. 
* <span class="notranslate">**From**</span>: specify a sender of all emails sent by the Hooks. 

The following events are available.

#### Real-Time scan: malware detected

Occurs when malware is detected during the real-time scanning.

![](/images/RealTimeScanDetected.png)

* <span class="notranslate">**Enable email notifications for admin**</span>: move the slider to <span class="notranslate">ON</span> to notify the administrator and a custom user list via email upon event occurrence.
